    1. Before this assignment I should have used Spring MVC since I'm more familiar with it. But it should be very interesting and fun to use
    other frameworks as JAX-RS. Maven I should have used, Guava is new to me and it seems to be very useful. I did find an article in this topic,
    which I red and I found it interesting: http://www.infoq.com/articles/springmvc_jsx-rs
    Dropwizard is also a new framework but I like it. Jackson I did use before and I should probably have choose it by myself as well.

    2. My impression is that the frameworks you did choose eases the developing process
    and when you got the deep understanding they helps you to make fast and simple solutions.
    Simple solutions for me means easy to maintain and high modularity making it possible to scale,
    increase performance and in a efficient way extend the system.
