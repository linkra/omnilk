* Rules:
    1. You're not allowed to have any getter/setter methods
           (that's to say you must not have any methods that expose/leak values from a class)

        2. You're only allowed to have one level of indention per method
           (tip: use "extract method" until you've achieved one level of indention)

        3. Any given class must not have more than 2 instance variables
           (tip: group data into separate smaller objects)

        4. You're not allowed to use `else`, `else if` or `switch`
           (regular `if` statements are fine)
